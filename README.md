# Arithmetic Dynamics

Side project from complex systems class. Take a function over a finite field, such as $f(x) = x^2 + 1$ over $\mathbb{Z}_5$. What does the resultant graph of mappings look like? Do there exists isomorphic graphs on the same field? How many graphs? Etc, questions. [This pdf](https://github.com/henrywallace/arithmetic-dynamics/blob/master/iter_arithmetic.pdf) goes over some visualization.
